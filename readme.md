# MIXBOARD

Idea came from a fightboard a friend of mine found on Etsy ([link here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/786877857/fightboard)).
Unfortunately, it is far too expensive and sold out.
So I decided to build it myself.
Additionally, I get to learn:
* design and 3D print the board;
* soldering;
* microcontrollers;


## Development
### CircuitPython
HID Library!
 - I need it to send key strokes or gamepad commands that my machine understands.

No async or multithreading :(

### MicroPython
Async!
Multithreading!

No HID library :(

## Microcontrollers
Bought them at [thepihut.com](https://thepihut.com)

### Raspberry Pico
Has 2 cores!

### Teensy LC
Smaller and different processor (?). Used by thnikk iirc

## Key Switches
I decided to get Kailh switches because they look cool.
I got them at [candykeys.com](https://candykeys.com)

## Board
Still need to design it

## Code
